1.Power

Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
Do this recursively.
Input format :
Two integers x and n (separated by space)
Output Format :
x^n (i.e. x raise to the power n)
Constraints :
0 <= x <= 30
0 <= n <= 30
Sample Input 1 :
 3 4
Sample Output 1 :
81
Sample Input 2 :
 2 5
Sample Output 2 :
32

Code:-

int power(int x, int n) {
  /* Don't write main().
     Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     Return output and don't print it.
     Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
  */
    if (x==0){
        return 0;
    }

}

6.First Index of Number


Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

if(size==0)
        return -1;

    }
    return pos;
}


9.All Indices of Number


Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the indexes in an array (in increasing order).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x

     Save all the indexes in the output array passed and return the size of output array.

    static int index=-1;
    if(size==0)
    {
        return 0;
